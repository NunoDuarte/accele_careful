# Acceleration Phase Carefulness Detection
![matlab compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/matlab-compatible-lightgrey.svg)

Utilize the acceleration phase during handover actions to detect whether the manipulated object is soft/heavy/fragile/risky 

- Eigen vectors in the acceleration phase

Check that it is solved:
I have to find a way to get the data to match the eigen vectors. Perhaps smoothing, or time intervals

## Compatibility

Successfully tested on:
* Mathworks MATLAB 2018a

## Getting Started
Run a minimal example in a Matlab interpreter like OCTAVE or MATLAB:
```
RUNME
```
To run all tests use:
```
TODO
```
To run demos use:
