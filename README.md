# Carefulness Detection
Utilize the acceleration phase during handover actions to detect whether the manipulated object is soft/heavy/fragile/risky 

- Eigen vectors in the acceleration phase

Check that it is solved:
I have to find a way to get the data to match the eigen vectors. Perhaps smoothing, or time intervals
